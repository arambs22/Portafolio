## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
The simulation features five robot agents tasked with organizing objects in a structured environment. Each robot uses:
- Computer vision (YOLO v5) for object detection
- Autonomous navigation with NavMesh
- Real-time metrics tracking
- 3D graphics and animations in Unity

## ðŸš€ Project Structure
### Part 1: Multi-Agent System
#### Agent Properties and Environment
- **Agent Type**: Robot Agent
- **Capabilities**:
  - NavMeshAgent-based movement (15 units speed)
  - Collision detection and handling
  - Object manipulation (pick/drop)
  - Inter-agent communication
  - Obstacle jumping (jumpForce = 5f)
  - Animated movement

*Robot performing object collection tasks*

#### Environment Properties
- NavMesh-defined navigation space
![Navigation Mesh](images/Navmesh.png)
*NavMesh configuration for autonomous navigation*

- Two distinct zones:
  - Red Zone (A): Collection area (-15, -1.19, 0)
![Zone A](images/zonaA.png)
*Collection zone where objects are initially placed*

  - Blue Zone (B): Delivery area (30, -1.19, 0)
![Zone B](images/zonaB.png)
*Delivery zone where objects are transported*

- Environmental challenges:
![Obstacles](images/obstaculos.png)
*Various obstacles and terrain challenges*

- Dungeon environment: ~120 x 25 x 180 units
- 10 randomly distributed cubes in red zone

*Example of dynamic lighting implementation in the environment*

#### Performance Metrics
The system tracks:
1. Cubes Delivered
2. Total Distance Traveled
3. Efficiency Ratio (cubes/distance)
4. Delivery Rate (cubes/minute)
